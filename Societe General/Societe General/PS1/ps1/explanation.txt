1. Currency Standardization: convert all currency to USD
2. Type, Pf_type, Country_Code vectorization: Convert String into numeric value which makes easy in comparison
3. Indicator_code, Hedge_value, Status: Lots of NANs So deleted entire column
4. Desk_id, Office_id, Pf_id: dropped as they are only used in identification
5. Normalization: mean, Standard Deviation normalization is done
   idea is to construct 0 mean with unit SD dataset

6. **As the data has high variance before normalization the best approach is to move with Gradient Boosting algorithm for regression**
7. Based on few experiments the best depth is 4, So it was used
8. Final model MAE: 0.0032
